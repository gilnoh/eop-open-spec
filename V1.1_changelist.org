=====
Spec v1.1.1 to v1.1.2 
=====
The following text outlines changes of version 1.1.2 

* Newly written section/subsections 

** Section Scoring Component (4.5) 
A generic component that provides "features". Now distance component 
is an extension of this scoring component type. 

** Subsection "interface LexicalResourceWithRelation" (4.7.3) 
Now we removed TERuleRelation from LexicalRule and LexicalResource, and 
moved them to part of "generic relational queries" of 
LexicalResourceWithRelation. 
It also now comes with related subsections like RelationSpecifiers. 

* Added descriptions / clarifications 
** Related to new sections 
Related to the above three section/subsections: related figures and
descriptions are changed in LexicalRule and DistanceComponent. 

** Changes in interface Component
Now the method initialize() is removed from the interface component.  

=====
Spec v1.1 to v1.1.1 
=====
The following text outlines changes related to version 1.1.1. 

* Newly written subsections 

** Section "Linguistic Analysis Pipeline (LAP)" added. (Sec 6)
This is a new section that holds a single small subsection that
describes interface =LAPAccess=. 

** Sub-section "Lexical Resources with Own Relations" added. (Sec 4.6.3) 
This is a new sub-section that describes interface
=LexicalResourceWithOwnRelations=. 

* Added descriptions / clarifications 

** Minor bug patches and clarifications 
- TEDecision removed from lexicalresource (was not synced with actual interface 
source) 
- string DEFAULT_CONFIDENT was corrected to double (was not synced with actual i
nterface) 
- Entailment.* types are now clarified: where to be put (EntailmentMetadata and 
Pair in the CAS, Text in TextView, Hypothesis in HypothesisView) 
- Metadata and Pair type supertype corrected (to TOP, was Annotation) 
- Clarification added on "higher confident" on TEDecision.

* Newly written subsections

** subsection "common log" added. (#96)
- In the Section 6.3

** subsection "Concurrent Processing" added. (#108, #19, #45) 
- In the Section 4.8
- "multi-thread" issue. 
- It adds a new interface EDAConcurrentProcessing, that gets a set of
  TE problems and return a set of TEDecisions, with concurrent
  processing. 

** subsection "Two groups of LAP components added"
- In the section 3.3.4.3 
- Clarification section that describes, LAP components that knows TE
  annotations, and generic components that does not. 
  
** subsection "Other cases: T-H from multiple documents, T-H on a same document" added. (#106)
- In the section 3.3.4.4 
- "T view / H view" naturally maps into two document (one for T, one
  for H). The section describes how we can cope with different
  situations like T on multiple documents, and T-H on the same
  document. 
- 3.3.4 generally revised = (from 3.3.4.1 to 3.3.4.4) 

** subsection "Boundary of LAP and Entailment Core" 
- In the section 6.5 
- Summarizes the discussion covered untill now. 

** sub-subsection "Rooms for improvment: EDA common training" added (#35, deferred issue #109 ) 
- In the section 4.2.1.7 

* Added Descriptions / Clarifications (Moved sections, added a paragraph, etc) 

** Representation of Text and Hypothesis revised (more clear description) 
- Section 3.3.4.1 and 3.3.4.2 revised: From Section 3.3.4.1 to 3.3.4.4
  worth a new reading for all readers. 

** "Auxiliary Layer" section added, and some interfaces moved into it (#101)  
- Section 4.3 
- "MultipleMode helper", "SinglePairProcessHelper (previously
  EDARawTextWithLAP)", and "InitializationHelper"  now stays in
  "Auxiliary Layer". 
- #101 (Something that calls both EDA and LAP cannot be an
  EDA interface) resolved.  EDARawTextWithLAP -> overhauled as an
  independent "helper".  

** (Clarification) List of interfaces that an EDA can implement 
- In the section 4.2.1.8
- At the end of EDABasic, a short section summarizes additional
  interfaces that an EDA can implement. It also lists the list of
  auxilary layer interfaces. 

** EDAs can now implement "Reconfigurable". (#97) 
- In the section 4.9.2, it also describes about EDA and reconfigurable  

** (Clarification) "NonEntailment" relation of "LexicalRule" (#100). 
- In the section 4.6.1.2
- a description is added to clarify what is "NonEntailment" lexical
  rule. (in the =TELexicalRelation= =NonEntailment= description. )  

** (Clarification) About "Instance Subsection" of configuration (#105) 
- In the section 5.1.2
- a description with example is added to clarify what "instance"
  configuration is about. 

* Data type fixed / expanded 
** BasicNode now has canonical types that reflects UIMA types (#90) 
- Section 4.7.1.3 and Figure 11. 
- enum DependencyRelationType, enum NamedEntity, enum CanonicalPosTag. 

** EDA interface now becomes generic with types that extends TEDecision (#73)
- TEDecision object description (removed Object returning getInfo,
  added extension description) 
- Generic affected parts of EDABasic, EDAMulti*, InitializationHelper, MutipleTHModeHelper 

** "relation" (canonical relation) of Lexical Resource (#89) 
- Section 4.6.1 (and 4.6.1.2) 
- it is now a new enum type of its own (=TELexicalRelation=), which
  can hold  =Entailment= or =NonEntailment=. It no longer reuses the
  Decision enum of EDA decision. 

** EntailmentMetadata now holds additional fields 
- Section 3.3.4.1
- it now holds TextDocumentID, TextCollectionID, HypothesisDocumentID,
  and HypothesisCollectionID. 

** type EXCITEMENT.temporal.TemporalExpression expanded (#103) 
- Section 3.3.3.9 and Appendix A.9 
- We now have expanded temporal expression with subtypes according to
  TIMEX3-like classification.  

** "alignment" type now has a string feature named "type". (#80) 
- Section 3.3.3.10 
- Alignment now has a string for additional info. 

* Misc 
** All runtime type check (RTTI) removed from core interface (#36) 
- The only exception is JCas, where we cannot avoid using RTTI. 

* WONTFIX Issues (Issues that were decided not to fix, after WP3 discussion) 
** All name changes
- Issue #99 ("Basic" names), #102 ("EDA"), #95 ("processXX")
- WP3 ITD discussed these issues, but decided to keep on the current
  names. See each issue ticket for discussion summaries.  

** "Low-level" interface like getLHS, getRHS also for SyntacticResource 
- Issue #6. See the ticket for the discussion summary. 

** "High-Level" interface for LexicalResource 
- Issue #7. See the ticket for the discussion summary. 

** Web Interface - consideration for Web interface. (at least known incompatibilities should be avoided) 
- Issue #34. No known incompatibilities with generic, thus we've
  adopted generic interfaces even on EDA. The issue for now (conflict
  with Generic) is closed, and (future) Web interface issue will be
  raised when detected.  

** SyntacticRules might need additional mappings
- Issue #53. See the ticket for the discussion summary.

** ITD subgroup report URL is not on the official site. 
- Issue #84. See the ticket for the discussion summary.

** Initialize() should be in the constructor?
- Issue #92. See the ticket for the discussion summary.

** Separation of training and process of EDA 
- Issue #93. See the ticket for the discussion summary

** Adding "parent" link to BasicNode 
- Issue #94. See the ticket for the discussion summary

** What if we need "Probability of Entailment", instead of "Confidence of decision"? 
- Issue #98. See the ticket for the discussion summary 


* Deferred Issues after WP3 discussion 
** Providing more common "training" and "model" (#108) 

** Supporting additional use-cases (like "text-expansion"). (#104) 

** "Intelligent configuration" (configuration with metadata) (#65)
